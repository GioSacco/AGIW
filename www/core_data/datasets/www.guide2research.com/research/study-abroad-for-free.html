                                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Education and huge expenses are often associated with one another, and for a good reason. In the United States, for instance, college costs have spiked up by more than 25% in the past decade (Hess, 2019). Exploring educational options overseas has become an attractive proposition. Besides high-quality education, many schools in Europe offer free education. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This article explores the option to study abroad for free, as it covers the reasons why people study abroad, the fees involved (if there any), and the countries that offer free education. Students from developed countries will have a wider set of cost-effective options while those from developing countries will learn that they can gain a competitive educational advantage abroad without having to break their bank accounts. </span></p>

<h2 id="1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why Study Abroad?</span></h2>
<p>The prospect of studying abroad is not a novel concept. In fact, the number of international students has risen from 2 million in 1999 (Moreira &amp; Gomes, 2018) to 5.3 million in 2017 (UNESCO, 2020), with more than half of them enrolled in educational institutions coming from six countries. Those nations are the United States, U.K., Australia, France, Germany, and Russia (Migration Data Portal, 2020). This upward trend is likely to continue since there is a slew of benefits in obtaining a foreign degree.</p>
<p>One of the biggest considerations in studying abroad is how a diploma from a foreign university, especially if it is from a developed country, increases the perceived value of a student&#8217;s curriculum vitae (Tucker, 2020). This adds credibility to a student&#8217;s listed competencies, particularly if the school or country in which they received their education from is known for the academic field entered. The cross-cultural collaboration, networking, and language skills developed from studying abroad are also highly valued in the professional realm.</p>
<p>According to research from the Erasmus Student Network, <a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.huffpost.com/entry/want-a-job-new-research-p_b_8474418#:~:text=Not%20only%20will%20you%20look,quickly%20if%20you%20study%20abroad.&amp;text=If%20that%20isn');"  href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/want-a-job-new-research-p_b_8474418#:~:text=Not%20only%20will%20you%20look,quickly%20if%20you%20study%20abroad.&amp;text=If%20that%20isn't%20enough,who%20did%20not%20study%20abroad.">92% of employers prefer their employees to have transversal skills</a>, which are developed by studying abroad (Matthews, 2017).  Furthermore, in a study by the University of California, it was found that 97% of students who studied abroad found a job within a year of graduation (Matthews, 2017).</p>
<p>Another consideration is the travel and tourism-related opportunities from international education (Moreira &amp; Gomes, 2018). Students get to immerse themselves in a new culture, varied interpersonal dynamics, and a plethora of interesting locations and cuisines. During holidays, they can become tourists as they get acquainted with the special features of various locales. This level of freedom enhances a learner&#8217;s adaptability and self-reliance, which could lead to an international network of friends.</p>
<p>There are cases when a student&#8217;s preferred course is not available locally or the available prospects are deemed inferior to their international counterparts. In this scenario, some learners elect to pursue their education overseas. Making such a decision is not too daunting given the international scholarships granted by schools (Tucker, 2020) as well as the convenient arrangements in terms of bureaucratic requirements (Moreira &amp; Gomes, 2018).</p>
<p>Finally, an emerging consideration to study abroad is the cost. Remarkably, a lot of countries offer free education to the public sector, and this includes international students (Tucker, 2019). Some of those nations have exceptional academic programs, with countries like Germany, Finland, and Australia doing well in international surveys (Tucker, 2019).</p>
<p>Given the absence of tuition fees, learners from developing countries can afford to receive education in a free university from a major economy and reap the countless benefits. On the other hand, students from developed countries can obtain quality education for a fraction of local costs.</p>

<h2 id="2"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Is a Free University Absolutely Free? </span></h2>
<p>Universities that offer free education typically have no tuition fees and are <strong>public schools</strong>. In place of those are nominal fees to cover the campus&#8217; administration costs (Tucker, 2020). So, technically, a free university is not absolutely free, but the amount a learner has to pay is nowhere near as high as the tuition fees charged by private schools, including those from developing countries. For instance, a free university from Norway could charge $66 for two semesters. This is a far cry from the average fee in private American universities, which amounts to $48,510 annually (Bridgestock, 2019).</p>
<p>It is important to note that the administration fees from free universities may vary from one country to another and one city to the next. There are also certain requirements set by schools before giving international students access to their programs, which could include learning the local vernacular and having sufficient funds to sustain costs per year.</p>
<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Countries That Offer Free Education</span></h2>
<h3 id="3">Germany</h3>
<p>Germany has earned a reputation of being one of the most ideal destinations for international education (Bessey, 2017), and rightfully so. Nearly all of its states have abolished tuition fees for undergraduate students at public universities and it is also home to a highly regarded education system. After all, 46 German schools made it to the QS World University Rankings, eight of which are in the top 150 (Tucker, 2019). In addition, there are nearly 300 public universities in the country, so learners have a wealth of options (Study.eu, 2020).</p>
<p><strong>Who are eligible? </strong></p>
<p>Anyone can study in Germany for free, regardless of nationality. However, students who reside outside the European Union (EU) are required to submit a residence permit prior to entering the country (Study.eu, 2020). They should also finish their studies in the country if they are to receive free education. Moreover, a German student visa is required to study in the country.</p>
<p><strong>Education costs</strong></p>
<p>Typically, public universities in Germany charge a nominal fee ranging from $170-$280 annually, which covers administration costs (Tucker, 2019). Since the country has one of the world&#8217;s biggest economies, students can expect first-rate facilities and education programs.</p>
<p><strong>Living expenses</strong></p>
<p>In order to acquire a German visa, students must prove that they have $11,330 per year to cover their living expenses. Germany&#8217;s cost of living is more affordable than that of other Western European nations. Rent, on average, ranges from $290 to $340 while the monthly food cost is $205 (Playdon, 2020).</p>

<h3 id="4">Finland</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finland attracts global attention due to its exceptional education system. It was the top performer among the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries in the 2000 and 2003 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), and the only country that improved scholastic performance (Sahlberg, 2011). In the 2015 PISA, Finland once again</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> posted marks in science, mathematics, and reading that are well above the average PISA scores (Motoi, 2018). It is also recognized by Universitas 21, a group that measures the standing of higher education systems, as having the <a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.timeshighereducation.com/news/universitas-21-finland-leads-world-pound-pound-basis');"  href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/universitas-21-finland-leads-world-pound-pound-basis">most effective higher education system in the world when accounting for national income levels</a> (Bothwell, 2020).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the terms of free education are not as inclusive as that of Germany, the existent fees are relatively affordable. </span></p>
<p><strong>Who are eligible?</strong></p>
<p>Tuition fees are waived for residents of the EU, European Economic Area (EEA), and Switzerland. International students can avail of free education if they opt to go for a course taught in Finnish or Swedish or if they hold a fixed-term residence permit (Study.eu, 2017). Furthermore, there are a lot of scholarships available to those who do not qualify for free education. International learners should apply for a student visa if they wish to study in Finland.</p>
<p><strong>Education costs</strong></p>
<p>Those who live outside of the E.U., E.E.A., and Switzerland will have to pay, on average, $4,800-$24,500 annually should they want to take a bachelor&#8217;s or a master&#8217;s degree (Top Universities, nd). The fees vary depending on the course, university, and the school&#8217;s location.</p>
<p><strong>Living expenses</strong></p>
<p>According to the University of Helsinki, the average monthly living expenses of students fall around $804-$1,147 (University of Helsinki, 2020), with the rent in Helsinki costing $516-$804 (University of Helsinki, 2020). Since Helsinki is Finland&#8217;s capital, those numbers are likely to go down in other areas.</p>
<p>To qualify for a student visa, students must prove that they have at least $8,100 per year (Top Universities, nd) which covers the living costs.</p>

<h3 id="5">France</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a comparative study among host European countries, international students studying in France are approaching or even surpassing the OECD average scores, especially in reading, mathematics, and science (Motoi, 2018). This is reflective of the caliber of the country&#8217;s education system, which is why it has been drawing the attention of international learners worldwide. Like with Finland, not everyone qualifies for free education, but the number of scholarships the country has on offer has recently increased to 21,000 (Tucker, 2019). </span></p>
<p><strong>Who are eligible? </strong></p>
<p>Free education is extended to French nationals as well as the residents of the E.U., E.E.A., and Switzerland. Though billed as free, students will have to shoulder annual costs, but they are remarkably low (Study.eu, 2020). International students, on the other hand, will have to pay relatively small tuition fees if they choose to study in the country. Normally, doctorate programs only charge nominal fees for all learners, regardless of nationality (Study.eu, 2020).</p>
<p><strong>Education costs</strong></p>
<p>For French nationals and residents of the E.U., E.E.A., and Switzerland, the annual nominal fee is only $190 for bachelor&#8217;s degrees (Tucker, 2019) and $279 master&#8217;s degrees (Study.eu, 2020).  Those who do not qualify for free education, on the other hand, will have to shoulder $3,183 for a bachelor&#8217;s degree and $4,331 for their masters (Study.eu, 2020). Doctorate programs charge a fee of $436 across the board.</p>
<p><strong>Living expenses</strong></p>
<p>On average, students are expected to have at least $10,620 per year. Monthly expenses should be around $977-$1,149 in most major cities. Should a student elect to live in Paris, the cost spikes up to $1,437-$1,609 monthly (Study.eu, 2020).</p>
<p><strong>Notable free universities (for EU, EEA, and Switzerland residents)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>University of Orleans</li>
<li>University of Burgundy</li>
<li>Parsons Paris</li>
<li>Univerisity of Bordeaux I</li>
<li>University of Strasbourg</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="6">Norway</h3>
<p>When a student intends to study abroad for free, Norway should be the first nation that comes to mind in terms of education costs. Public education is free for both local and international students, with the institutions only charging a nominal fee (Top Universities, nd). And with regard to nominal fees, theirs are even lower than those offered by other European nations. Although most courses are taught in Norwegian, there are schools that offer courses in English, all of which also do not come with tuition fees.</p>
<p><strong>Who are eligible? </strong></p>
<p>Public schools in Norway normally do not charge tuition fees to students, regardless if they are local or international, with the exception of a few specialty courses and post-graduate programs (Top Universities, nd).</p>
<p><strong>Education costs</strong></p>
<p>On average, the nominal fees charged by schools amount to only $33-$66 (Top Universities, nd). This gives students access to a school&#8217;s facilities, including sports facilities and healthcare services. It also grants students an ID from which discounts on transportation can be availed.</p>
<p><strong>Living expenses</strong></p>
<p>While the education costs are low in Norway, the living expenses are high. To obtain a student permit, learners must have at least $13,294 each year while studying (Study in Norway, nd). The average monthly costs for students range from $921 to $1,612. This <a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.mastersportal.com/articles/1664/study-in-norway-tuition-fees-and-living-costs.html');"  href="https://www.mastersportal.com/articles/1664/study-in-norway-tuition-fees-and-living-costs.html">increases to $1,382-$2,303</a> should a student opt to reside in Oslo, Norway&#8217;s capital (Paseola, A., 2019).</p>
<p><strong>Notable free universities</strong></p>

</ul>
<h3 id="7">Denmark</h3>
<p>Sitting at third in the 2020 Universitas 21 ranking (Bothwell, 2020), Denmark is known for its academic excellence and is a popular destination for international students within the E.U. Its education system is well-funded by the government for teaching and research and has an expansive international network (Study in Denmark, nd). Denmark might not have the inclusive approach to tuition-free education of Germany or Norway, but the quality of its academic programs more than makes up for that.</p>
<p><strong>Who are eligible? </strong></p>
<p>Tuition-free education is provided to the residents of the E.U., E.E.A., and Switzerland, and exchange students. People from countries outside those zones must have a permanent or temporary residence permit to receive free education. The same is extended to students whose parent carries a residence permit based on employment (Study in Denmark, nd).</p>
<p><strong>Education costs</strong></p>
<p>Education is free for those who qualify and will likely deal with only a small administration fee per year. For those who are not eligible, the tuition fees in Denmark range from $6,670 to $17,800 annually (Tucker, 2019).</p>
<p><strong>Living expenses</strong></p>
<p>To obtain a student visa, a student must carry at least $1,080 per month. Staying in an off-campus residence hall would cost $280-$496 per month while renting a private room yields a monthly charge of $1,020. If the student opts to stay in Copenhagen, Denmark&#8217;s capital, the average room rate goes up to $1,465 (Lane, 2020).</p>

<h3 id="8">Austria</h3>
<p>Lying in the heart of Europe, Austria is famous for its art and architecture and provides easy access to its neighboring countries. Students will have a date with history as they walk around Vienna and the other major cities. As for education, Austria has nine schools in the top 1000 of the Times Higher Education ranking (Thompson, 2019) and is known for its programs on medicine and science.</p>
<p><strong>Who are eligible? </strong></p>
<p>Students from the E.U., E.E.A., and Switzerland can enjoy tuition-free education. Some universities waive the tuition fees of international learners who come from developing countries. And there are universities that offer free education to all learners, regardless of their nationality (Peitl, 2019).</p>
<p><strong>Education costs</strong></p>
<p>While education is tuition-free, students will have to pay a small accident insurance fee of $23 per year (Peitl, 2019). Those who are not exempt from paying tuition fees will have to spend, on average, $1,676 annually should they enroll in a public school. Private universities charge anywhere between $3,464 and $26,556 annually (Peitl, 2019).</p>
<p><strong>Living expenses</strong></p>
<p>To obtain a student visa, students must prove that they have the means to produce at least $595 per month if they are below the age of 24. Those who are 24 and above should have at least $1,079 each month (Study in Austria, nd).</p>

<h3 id="9">Sweden</h3>
<p>As the birthplace of the Nobel Peace Prize, Sweden is known for its contributions to the music industry and its excellent craftsmanship. Science and technology are among its top competences, which carry over to its educational programs. The country has 12 universities in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings (Times Higher Education, nd) and has applied innovative means in instruction, such as its emphasis on group and independent learning over traditional lectures (Lungu, 2019).</p>
<p><strong>Who are eligible? </strong></p>
<p>Students from the E.U., E.E.A., and Switzerland enjoy tuition-free education in most public universities (Lungu, 2019). On the other hand, those from outside the said regions are required to pay tuition fees and a separate fee for every application. PhD programs, however, are tuition-free for all learners, regardless of nationality (Lungu, 2019).</p>
<p><strong>Education costs</strong></p>
<p>Students who are eligible for tuition-free education will only pay a small fee for their schooling. For those who are not eligible, they will have to pay anywhere between $10,560 and $17,595 annually, along with a university application fee of $106, if they choose to study in Sweden (Top Universities, nd).</p>
<p><strong>Living expenses</strong></p>
<p>To obtain a study permit in Sweden, students must prove that they have at least $940 for every year that they are in the country (Top Universities, nd). As far as living costs are concerned, the average monthly expenditure of students is around $811-$1,391 (Lungu, 2019).</p>

<h3 id="10">Greece</h3>
<p>With its historical legacy, rich culture, and impeccable architecture, Greece&#8217;s history and places of interest, alone, are already fine reasons to study in the country. There is also the added novelty of taking a philosophy or architecture course in the nation where some of history&#8217;s greatest luminaries in those fields resided. And taking a literature course at the birthplace of Greek Mythology sounds equally enticing. If those reasons are not enough, the country also offers tuition-free education to learners from select regions of Europe (Csusz, 2019).</p>
<p><strong>Who are eligible? </strong></p>
<p>Most public universities offer tuition-free education to learners who reside in the E.U., E.E.A., and Switzerland. Some master&#8217;s degrees, however, charge tuition fees (Top Universities, nd).</p>
<p><strong>Education costs</strong></p>
<p>International students who are non-residents of the E.U., E.E.A., and Switzerland will have to pay tuition fees amounting to around $1,739 &#8211; $10,431 for each year, inclusive of textbooks (Csusz, 2019).</p>
<p><strong>Living expenses</strong></p>
<p>On average, the monthly living costs of students range from $522 to $811, which is low compared to other European nations (Csusz, 2019). Rent is around $279-$522. Food is quite cheap; students who are keen to try street fare can get a decent meal for less than $6.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="11">Czech Republic</h3>
<p>The Czech Republic is an emerging destination for international students given the beauty of its cities and its modest education and living costs. In fact, it has around 43,000 international students in higher education, according to the country&#8217;s education ministry (European Commission, nd). Prague, Czech Republic&#8217;s capital, has been recognized as one of the 50 best cities for students by Quacarelli Symonds (Top Universities, 2019).</p>
<p><strong>Who are eligible? </strong></p>
<p>Education in public universities is free for all nationalities, provided that the students can understand and communicate in Czech (Top Universities, nd). This applies even to residents of the E.U., E.E.A., and Switzerland.</p>
<p><strong>Education costs</strong></p>
<p>For courses taught in English, learners will have to shoulder fees amounting to $4,425-$13,275 (Tucker, 2019). Students who intend to enroll in a private university are required to pay tuition fees, which, on average, range from $2,000 to $15,000 per year (Top Universities, nd).</p>
<p><strong>Living expenses</strong></p>
<p>Like Greece, the living expenses in the Czech Republic are affordable. The average monthly expenditure of students should be around $350-$750, inclusive of rent, food, and transportation (Top Universities, nd). This figure should increase if a student opts to reside in Prague or any major city.</p>

<h3 id="12">Iceland</h3>
<p>Known as &#8220;The Land of Fire and Ice,&#8221; Iceland&#8217;s natural attractions make it an appealing destination for all types of travelers, including international students. It is home to glaciers, volcanoes, and the Northern Lights with zero mosquitoes. As for education, there are only seven universities in Iceland, four of which are public (Top Universities, nd). And those public universities welcome those who want to study abroad for free in the same manner as Germany and Norway.</p>
<p><strong>Who are eligible? </strong></p>
<p>Iceland&#8217;s four public schools offer tuition-free education to learners of all nationalities. Instead of a tuition fee, students are to shoulder a small annual registration fee (Global Scholarships, 2019).</p>
<p><strong>Education costs</strong></p>
<p>The nominal annual fees charged vary between public universities in Iceland. The University of Iceland, for instance, charges $470 per year (Top Universities, nd) while others could charge up to $750 annually (Global Scholarships, 2019). Private universities, on the other hand, charge tuition fees ranging from $5,000 to $20,000 per year (Global Scholarships, 2019).</p>
<p><strong>Living expenses</strong></p>
<p>The University of Iceland suggests that students have $980 monthly to cover their living expenses (Top Universities, nd). And this figure goes up to $2,000 should a student decide to stay in Reykjavik, Iceland&#8217;s capital (Global Scholarships, 2019). The living expenses are higher compared to many of the countries on this list, so learners should find scholarships, part-time jobs, or pre-plan their budgets before studying in Iceland.</p>
<p><strong>Notable free universities</strong></p>

<h2 id="13"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Academic and Social Support Services: Current Practices</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Academic and social support services for international students are essential to continued international student matriculation, engagement, and success in U.S. higher education (Cho &amp; Yu, 2015 cited in Martirosyan et al., 2019). After all, some international students are likely to find difficulties in adjusting to the academic and social norms of their host countries. </span></p>
<p>The language barrier, for instance, is a primary deterrent to performance in a classroom setting, with tests, recitation, and exercises requiring fluency from all learners. This is why the support programs in the U.S. center on bridging the language gap through remedial classes (Martiryosan, et al., 2019). On the social front, concerns could also arise given the differences in social norms and values relative to nations. The lack of meaningful relationships during the educational journey, furthermore, influences international student dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>In light of the aforementioned challenges, <span style="font-weight: 400;">the top 20 U.S. universities that hosted the largest number of international students created programs that address various concerns based on extant literature </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Martirosyan et al., 2019).  </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>English Language Programs</strong>. These programs are designed to increase a learner&#8217;s English language proficiency and are divided according to the students&#8217; proficiency levels. The skills honed include speaking, listening, reading, and writing. Some universities offer a more intimate approach by pairing a native English speaking teacher with an international student (Martrisyosan et al., 2019).   </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Academic Support Initiatives</strong>. In an effort to decrease the gap in academic performance, a lot of universities conduct new student orientations, advising, seminars on academic life, and supplemental instruction, among others (Martrisyosan et al., 2019). </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Writing Support</strong>. For a non-native speaker, developing the ability to write academic literature will not be achieved through simple remedial programs alone, which is why a lot of universities have programs solely dedicated to writing support (Martrisyosan et al., 2019).  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Professional Development</strong>. With some international students looking to find careers in their host country, some universities introducing them to the local professional realm&#8217;s norms and practices. Typical activities in professional development programs include tax preparation and identifying job opportunities in the country (Martrisyosan et al., 2019). </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Sociocultural Development</strong>. For meaningful exchanges between learners to take place, special social events are organized by universities to make international students feel welcome and for local students to gain a deeper appreciation for foreign cultures (Martrisyosan et al., 2019).</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While these activities are from international-student-friendly universities in the U.S., the schools in Europe are likely to have similar programs given the E.U.&#8217;s push to attract and retain more international students (European Migration Network, 2019). The structures of the programs may be different, but they carry the same thing in mind: Make life in school as enriching and fulfilling as possible.      </span></p>
<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Europe—A Favorite Destination among Foreign Students</span></h2>
<p>Learners who plan to study abroad for free have a multitude of worthwhile options. Although &#8220;free education&#8221; does not exactly pertain to costless education (Tucker, 2020), the expenses that international students or their families will have to shoulder are much lower than the tuition fees typically charged by private universities both in developed and developing countries.</p>
<p>Besides many a free university, a lot of learners pursue their studies overseas due to the value that a foreign university adds to one&#8217;s curriculum vitae (Tucker, 2o20). For instance, students coming from a relatively poor nation who graduated from a European university will have an edge in the job market should they return to their home country. Other reasons for studying overseas include the development of transversal skills, the lack or absence of a preferred course in the home country, and the opportunity to immerse in a foreign country&#8217;s culture and special features (Tucker, 2020; Moreira &amp; Gomes, 2018; Matthews, 2017).</p>
<p>Based on the countries covered in this article, Europe comes as the ideal destination for students who intend to avail of tuition-free or low-cost education, as many of the continent&#8217;s nations provide such. Education for a lot of countries in Europe is government-funded, with its high standards religiously maintained. As a testament to the quality of European education, countries like Germany, Finland, Denmark, and Sweden continue to rank high in various global university rankings (Bothwell, 2020).</p>
<p>Germany is the foremost option for international students since it possesses all the ideals for foreign learners; a globally recognized academic program, the biggest economy in Europe, good tourism, and tuition-free education (Tucker, 2019). Finland, on the other hand, is known to have some of the &#8220;most effective universities in the world. (Bothwell, 2020).&#8221;</p>
<p>Not all the countries featured in the article are completely inclusive when it comes to providing free education. While most of them offer tuition-free schooling to E.U., E.E.A., and Switzerland residents, only Germany, Norway, Iceland, and, in part, the Czech Republic waive the tuition fees of students who live outside the aforesaid locations (Tucker, 2019). However, the tuition fees in all the listed countries are considerably low, especially the fees from public universities. Combine that with the fact that every day comes as an elegant European vacation, which appeals to any student traveler.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, reading books or answering homework amid old-world architecture, a saucy meat dish, and an espresso at a quaint European cafe is already an attractive deal on its own, regardless of tuition fees.</p>
